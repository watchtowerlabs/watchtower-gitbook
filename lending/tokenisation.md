Starting with hardware tokenisation, a user creates a [bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spv.asp) or SPV via our partners, around their hardware when they request a new loan. This protects the asset and gives transfer rights in case the borrowing company defaults. Data about the bailor, asset and loan are gathered to store inside the hardware metadata PDA

Once the SPV is created, the borrower creates a bailment contract for possession. The bailor provides a receipt which is included in the metadata PDA and used to mint an NFT. The following is a simplified approach to the metadata PDA.
