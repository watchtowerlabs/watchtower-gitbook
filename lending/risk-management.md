Due to some hardware having higher security concerns due to regulations such as the [International Traffic in Arms Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations) (ITAR) and [Missile Technology Control Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Technology_Control_Regime) (MTCR), we use a Watchdogs model. These are vetted partners in the ecosystem that are involved in underwriting among other duties. When it comes to lending, they are the first to take on the loss due to illiquid lending positions and therefore incur the highest risk and therefore, the highest yields. They also participate in onboarding, asset approvals & pricing, risk management safeguards and governance.
