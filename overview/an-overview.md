Of the $65 billion in startup space investment since 2014, just 4%—about $2.6 billion—came from private credit alone. While that’s small for traditional markets standards, it represents a significant opportunity for crypto and blockchain-based lending. As the space sector evolves from Gen 1 leaders to new Gen 3 players, the biggest names now lean on private credit, transforming how space projects are financed. Over $500 million in credit have powered firms like SpaceX, Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile not counting prime contractors like Boeing.
