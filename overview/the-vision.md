# 🔮 The Vision

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Watchtower's vision is to build the financial and economic foundations for a Starfleet capable planet with the ultimate aim of being a truly planetary (country agnostic) space agency. The problem with agencies today is they rely on government funding which tends to have a myriad of priorities. A solution to this, is to have a planetary space agency that is rooted in its own economic and financial foundations - in plain terms, have its own currency, treasury and constitution. And to participate, all you have to be is a citizen of this planet with an urge to look after our planet while looking forward to our solar system.

The above diagram gives a brief overview of Watchtower's stack. At the bottom is its data acquisition layer, in the form of a DePIN or Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Network - with a sole purpose of identifying the state of a space object (active and passive). But state is not always accurate due to a myriad of sensor types and form factors. This is where curation markets, in the form of prediction markets comes in to:

1. accurately identify the state and&#x20;
2. the risk profile of the object within the sphere of Earth's orbital planes and its relation to other objects.

The combination of acquisition and curation enables a social graph with risk profiles of all space objects and provide an identity protocol to build sustainable products centered around individual space objects.&#x20;

Building this [hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) is a lifetime of work and requires people who want to see a vision of humanity that is more cohesive with the hope of a better future for everyone and their kids. The result includes but not limited to:

* Social graphs of satellites and other space objects to help sustain existing and build new products and data markets.&#x20;
* Identity and reputation of space assets and objects&#x20;
* Onchain financial products such as credit, insurance, asset creation, etc.
* Real-time streams of data (payments, micropayments, solar energy, etc.) with AI agent infused space assets via intra and inter-satellite links.
* Flatcoins for time of access for anyone



### Watchtower 🤝 ReFi

_How does Watchtower fit into the regenerative revolution in web3?_

[Watchtower](https://watchtower.world/)'s intention is to help humans coordinate in the space (operations, domain & situational awareness, etc.) community and help build Lego blocks such as time-banking satellite passes, in-orbit insurance corridors, satellite-specific credit scores, flatcoins and more, all with the intention to create a space debris market equivalent to the climate and carbon offset markets we have today that tackles climate change. Watchtower's role in this journey is to enable dynamic operational identities for space objects by democratising satellite tracking and risk data markets.&#x20;

The tools crypto/web3 has to offer help create highly efficient and liquid markets in a currently highly illiquid market. The current financial & economic infrastructure cannot pragmatically move humanity toward _a_ [_Starfleet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfleet) _future_. At the same time, a web3-powered space debris market helps us tackle the current issues around the crowding of orbital corridors, space debris, and junk and ensures a sustainable space environment.
