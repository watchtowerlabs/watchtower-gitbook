Watchtower is a set of web3 primitives that enable products and ecosystems inside and outside the space industry. It consists of three main subsystems:

1. At the bottom, is an acquisition funnel and also its own tracking data market. This funnel solely focuses on increasing data quantity to enable the broader objective of tracking data affordability (i.e. increasing data liquidity).
2. A data oracle (curation funnel) that acquires from a variety of sources and formats; assesses the accuracy and distributes it to consumers of data. This is effectively a curations market with a focus on increasing data quality to enable the broader objective of minimizing satellite state estimation uncertainty.
3. A risk pricing engine (risk funnel) that develops risk scores for individual space objects using a skin-in-the-game mechanism to crowd-sourcing. This is effectively an auction market with a focus on determining space object collision risk to enable the broader objective of minimizing probability dilution when determining risk.

_The objective of these three subsystems together, is to create a social graph for individual space objects (starting with active) like most social media platforms (i.e. Twitter/X, etc.). This builds reputation, identity and risk profiles that are key for onchain apps and products as mentioned in the next section._
