# 📱 Apps

Apps use the social graph as a focal point for reputation, identity, location and risk - all needed for financing space companies and their assets.&#x20;

Some examples of products and apps that are powered by the Watchtower Stack are mentioned in the [the-vision.md](../overview/the-vision.md "mention") section. But for this section, we will focus on the lending market being created. For more information on the lending market please refer to the [overview.md](../lending/overview.md "mention") section of the Lending Market.

Private credit and more specifically lending for space companies are currently limited, primarily to the problems stated in the [problem.md](../overview/problem.md "mention") section.&#x20;
