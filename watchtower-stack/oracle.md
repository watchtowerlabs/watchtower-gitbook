# 🔮 Oracle

There are two main curation markets:

1. Laika: A market to accurately identify the state of a space object (satellite, fairing, LV, etc.)
2. Dora: A market to accurately determine the risk profile of the object within the sphere of Earth's orbital planes and its relation to other objects.

The eventual configuration of both markets will be that of agentic-powered prediction markets due to the high volume & variety of the data needing to be curated.&#x20;

### Overview of Markets

1. Laika: A data oracle (curation funnel) that acquires from a variety of data sources and formats; assesses the accuracy and distributes it to consumers of data. This is effectively a curations market with a focus on increasing data quality to enable the broader objective of minimizing satellite state estimation uncertainty.
2. Dora: A risk pricing engine (risk funnel) that develops risk scores for individual space objects using a skin-in-the-game mechanism to crowd-sourcing. This is effectively an auction market with a focus on determining space object collision risk to enable the broader objective of minimizing probability dilution when determining risk.
