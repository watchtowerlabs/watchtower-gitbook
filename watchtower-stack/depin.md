# 🛜 DePIN

This is a vital layer for the entire Watchtower stack and the lend/borrow app. It primary function is to aid in determining the real-time state and probability of collision risk of a collateral asset for the purposes of redemption and repossession. Determining the real-time state and probability of collision risk persistently, helps us create a social graph of all space objects.
